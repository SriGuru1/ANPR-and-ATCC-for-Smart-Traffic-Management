## 🧠 Project Overview  

This project aims to develop an **intelligent traffic management system** using  
**Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** and  
**Automatic Traffic Classification and Control (ATCC)**.  

By leveraging **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**,  
the system automates real-time traffic monitoring, classification,  
and control — making roads safer and reducing congestion in smart city environments.  

### 🎯 Key Objectives
- Detect and recognize vehicle license plates automatically (ANPR)
- Classify vehicles (car, bus, bike, truck, etc.) in real-time (ATCC)
- Optimize traffic light timing dynamically based on traffic density
- Store and manage traffic data efficiently for analysis
