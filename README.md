## ðŸ§  Project Overview  

This project aims to develop an **intelligent traffic management system** using  
**Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** and  
**Automatic Traffic Classification and Control (ATCC)**.  

By leveraging **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision**,  
the system automates real-time traffic monitoring, classification,  
and control â€” making roads safer and reducing congestion in smart city environments.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
- Detect and recognize vehicle license plates automatically (ANPR)
- Classify vehicles (car, bus, bike, truck, etc.) in real-time (ATCC)
- Optimize traffic light timing dynamically based on traffic density
- Store and manage traffic data efficiently for analysis
## ðŸš€ Project Outcomes  

### âœ… 1. **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)**  
- Real-time detection and recognition of vehicle license plates.  
- Integrates OCR to extract alphanumeric details from plates.  
- Stores recognized vehicle data securely in the database.  

### âœ… 2. **Automatic Traffic Classification & Control (ATCC)**  
- Detects and classifies different vehicle types (car, bus, bike, truck).  
- Dynamically controls traffic signals based on vehicle density.  
- Enhances flow efficiency at busy intersections.  

### âœ… 3. **Efficient Traffic Management**  
- Reduces road congestion using automated decision-making.  
- Improves overall vehicle movement and reduces waiting time.  

### âœ… 4. **Smart City Integration**  
- Ready to integrate with IoT and smart city data systems.  
- Provides real-time analytics for city traffic control centers.
